# Notification Sound Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the notification sound file.

In production, replace this with an actual audio file:
- notification.mp3 (preferred)
- notification.wav
- notification.ogg

The sound should be:
- Short (1-2 seconds)
- Pleasant and not jarring
- Low volume by default
- Compatible across browsers

Example sources for notification sounds:
- https://freesound.org/
- https://zapsplat.com/
- Custom recording

File should be placed at: public/sounds/notification.mp3
