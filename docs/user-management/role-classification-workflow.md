## 🎯 **REGISTRATION STRATEGY**

### **PHASE 1: Initial Registration**

**Community Members:**
- **Direct Registration:** `member`, `student`
- **Auto-assigned:** `guest` (no registration needed)
- **Upgrade Path:** `member` → `senior_member` (activity-based)

**Business Partners:**
- **Recommended:** `verified_partner` (full features)
- **Specialized:** `manufacturer`, `supplier`, `brand` (specific business types)
- **Verification Required:** All business roles need admin approval

### **PHASE 2: Role Upgrade System**

**Automatic Upgrades:**
```php
// Community progression
guest → member (after registration)
member → senior_member (activity threshold)

// Business verification
manufacturer/supplier/brand → verified_partner (admin approval)
```

**Manual Upgrades:**
- Admin-initiated role changes
- User-requested upgrades with justification
- Penalty downgrades for violations

---

## 🔄 **UPGRADE WORKFLOW DESIGN**

### **1. Community Member Progression**

**member → senior_member Criteria:**
```php
$upgradeThresholds = [
    'posts_count' => 50,           // Minimum 50 posts
    'helpful_votes' => 25,         // 25+ helpful votes received
    'days_active' => 90,           // Active for 90+ days
    'reputation_score' => 100,     // Reputation ≥ 100
    'violations' => 0,             // No active violations
    'contributions' => 5,          // 5+ quality contributions
];
```

**Auto-upgrade Process:**
1. **Daily Check:** Cron job kiểm tra user metrics
2. **Threshold Validation:** Verify all criteria met
3. **Auto-upgrade:** Update role + send notification
4. **Badge Award:** Grant "Senior Member" badge

### **2. Business Partner Verification**

**Initial Business Registration:**
```php
// All business users start as unverified
$businessRoles = ['verified_partner', 'manufacturer', 'supplier', 'brand'];
$initialStatus = [
    'is_verified_business' => false,
    'verification_status' => 'pending',
    'submitted_at' => now(),
];
```

**Verification Workflow:**
1. **Document Submission:** Business license, tax certificate
2. **Admin Review:** Manual verification process
3. **Approval/Rejection:** Admin decision with notes
4. **Status Update:** Enable business features
5. **Notification:** Email confirmation to user

### **3. Role Downgrade System**

**Violation-based Downgrades:**
```php
$downgradeRules = [
    'spam_violations' => 'senior_member → member',
    'business_fraud' => 'verified_partner → suspended',
    'inactive_account' => 'any → guest (after 365 days)',
    'terms_violation' => 'any → restricted',
];
```

## 🛠️ **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **STEP 1: Update Registration Form ✅**

**Completed:**
- Added `verified_partner` option with "Recommended" badge
- Updated validation rules
- Enhanced UI with visual indicators
- Added upgrade notices for community members

### **STEP 2: Create Upgrade Service**

```php
// app/Services/RoleUpgradeService.php
class RoleUpgradeService
{
    public function checkCommunityUpgrades(): void
    {
        $eligibleUsers = User::where('role', 'member')
            ->where('created_at', '<=', now()->subDays(90))
            ->get();
            
        foreach ($eligibleUsers as $user) {
            if ($this->meetsUpgradeCriteria($user)) {
                $this->upgradeToSeniorMember($user);
            }
        }
    }
    
    public function processBusinessVerification(User $user, array $documents): void
    {
        // Create verification request
        // Queue admin review
        // Send notifications
    }
}
```

### **STEP 3: Admin Verification Dashboard**

**Features Needed:**
- Business verification queue
- Document review interface  
- Approval/rejection workflow
- Bulk operations
- Verification history

### **STEP 4: Automated Upgrade System**

**Cron Jobs:**
```php
// app/Console/Commands/CheckRoleUpgrades.php
class CheckRoleUpgrades extends Command
{
    public function handle(): void
    {
        $this->info('Checking community upgrades...');
        app(RoleUpgradeService::class)->checkCommunityUpgrades();
        
        $this->info('Processing business verifications...');
        app(RoleUpgradeService::class)->processBusinessVerifications();
    }
}
```
