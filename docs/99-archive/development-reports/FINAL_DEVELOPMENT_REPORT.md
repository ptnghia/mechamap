- **Category Support**: Added support for avatar, thread, showcase, page, document, CAD file categories
- **CAD File Support**: Enhanced support for DWG, STEP, IGES files with metadata extraction
- **Security**: Added file validation, virus scanning placeholders, size limits

#### 📊 MediaController Features:
- Enhanced pagination and filtering by category, user, file type
- Bulk approval system for admin management  
- Media statistics dashboard
- Thumbnail generation for images
- Category-based organization with approval workflow

#### 🎨 Avatar Support Implementation:
- **Categories**: Added `avatar_url`, `avatar_media_id`, `banner_url`, `banner_media_id` columns
- **Forums**: Added avatar, banner, and gallery support with `gallery_media_ids` array
- **Model Updates**: Enhanced Category and Forum models with media relationships
- **Migration**: Successfully applied avatar support migration

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### 🗃️ Database Migrations Applied:
1. ✅ `2025_06_12_100001_create_countries_regions_system.php` - Geographic system
2. ✅ `2025_06_12_102741_add_avatar_support_to_categories_and_forums.php` - Avatar support

### 🏗️ Model Enhancements:

#### Country Model:
```php
// 26 fillable fields including mechanical engineering data
// Relationships: hasMany(Region), hasMany(User), hasManyThrough(Forum)
// Helper methods: getTimezoneOptions(), getMechanicalSpecialties()
```

#### Region Model:
```php  
// 23 fillable fields including industrial and technical data
// Relationships: belongsTo(Country), hasMany(User), hasMany(Forum)
// Geographic methods: distanceFrom(), nearbyRegions()
```

#### Enhanced Category Model:
```php
// Added avatar and banner support
// New relationships: avatarMedia(), bannerMedia()
// Smart getters: getAvatarUrlAttribute(), getBannerUrlAttribute()
```

#### Enhanced Forum Model:
```php
// Added avatar, banner, gallery support  
// Geographic integration with regions
// Gallery method: galleryMedia() with ordered results
```

### 🌐 API Controllers Created:

#### GeographyController (9 endpoints):
- Full CRUD operations for countries and regions
- Location-based filtering for standards and CAD software
- Regional forum integration
- Mechanical engineering specialization queries

#### Enhanced MediaController:
- User-organized file upload system
- Category-based file management
- Approval workflow for media files
- Statistics and analytics dashboard

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### ✅ API Testing Results:
- **Countries Endpoint**: Returns 6 countries with full mechanical engineering data
- **Featured Regions**: Returns 5 featured engineering regions (Ho Chi Minh, Hanoi, California, Michigan, Tokyo)
- **Standards API**: Successfully returns Vietnam standards: ["TCVN","ISO","JIS"]
- **CAD Software API**: Returns Japan CAD software: ["SolidWorks","CATIA","NX","Inventor"]
- **Continents**: Returns ["Asia","Europe","North America"]

### 🔍 System Validation:
