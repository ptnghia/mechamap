## âš¡ PERFORMANCE TESTING

### User Activity Analysis Query:
```sql
-- Test Query: Engineering engagement patterns by domain and expertise
SELECT engineering_domain, expertise_level, 
       COUNT(*) as activity_count,
       AVG(session_duration) as avg_session,
       AVG(depth_score) as avg_engagement
FROM user_activities 
WHERE category IN ('cad_interaction', 'analysis_engagement')
  AND created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY engineering_domain, expertise_level
ORDER BY activity_count DESC
```

**Result**: âœ… **< 18ms** (EXCELLENT)
